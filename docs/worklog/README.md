# Worklog

Persistent notes for cross-context agent work.

## Structure

One file per work session or feature chunk:
```
docs/worklog/
  YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md
```

## Guidelines (Loose)

Each entry should help the next agent pick up where you left off. Consider including:

- **Date/Session ID**: When this work happened
- **Objective**: What you set out to do
- **Context**: What state was the codebase in when you started?
- **Work Done**: What you actually accomplished
- **Decisions**: Any choices you made and why
- **Open Questions**: Unresolved issues for next agent
- **Next Steps**: Suggested continuation path
- **Blockers**: Anything that prevented progress

Not all sections are required. Use what's relevant.

## Reading Order

When onboarding, read entries from newest to oldest until you have sufficient context (usually 2-3 entries).

## Cleanup

Old entries can be archived to `docs/worklog/archive/` when no longer relevant (e.g., after a feature is complete and tested).
