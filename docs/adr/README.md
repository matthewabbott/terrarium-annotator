# Architecture Decision Records

Key decisions with context and rationale.

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](001-sqlite-over-json.md) | SQLite over JSON for storage | Accepted | 2026-01-01 |

## Template

New ADRs should follow this structure:

1. **Title**: Short descriptive name
2. **Status**: Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
3. **Context**: What situation prompted this decision?
4. **Decision**: What did we decide?
5. **Consequences**: What are the tradeoffs?

## Creating New ADRs

Use sequential numbering: `002-descriptive-name.md`, `003-another-decision.md`, etc.

Keep ADRs focused on a single decision. If multiple related decisions need to be made, create separate ADRs that reference each other.
